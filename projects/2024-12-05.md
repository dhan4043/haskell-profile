## Description

During my junior year at UMD I took a web development course that focused on mastering the fundamentals of JavaScript (Node.js), HTML and CSS. My favorite project from the course required us to create a web app that fulfilled the following requirements:

1. The app makes use of some API (I chose the [WebAudio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) API)
2. The app interacts with an external database (I chose MongoDB)

I decided to write a miniature polyphonic synthesizer that plays notes in response to keystrokes. The synth offers four waveforms (sine, triangle, saw, square), an [ADSR](https://www.aulart.com/blog/understanding-amplitude-and-filter-envelopes/) envelope, an oscilloscope, volume/octave controls, and the ability to save/load custom settings aka "patches" from a shared database.

## Project Breakdown

- Synth sounds are generated via the WebAudio API.
- Patches are saved/read/deleted via a MongoDB database.
- UI elements are styled with CSS and generated from embedded JavaScript templates ([EJS](https://ejs.co/)).

The final product can be found [here](https://mini-synth.onrender.com/).
