This project was taken from a data science course that I took during my junior year at UMD. We were given the task of assessing the spending effiency of the "Moneyball" Oakland Athletics relative to the rest of the league. The full Jupyter Notebook file can be viewed on [this](https://dhan4043.github.io/mlb-moneyball/index.html) GitHub page.
