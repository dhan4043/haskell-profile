During my freshman and sophomore years at the University of Maryland, I had the privilege of participating in the university's First Year Innovation and Research Experience (FIRE) program. We spent the first year learning key research concepts and familiarizing ourselves with the R programming language. The following year, we were given the opportunity to apply these skills and present our own research proposals/findings to other students at Undergraduate Research Day. My research group decided to focus on noise complaints within the city of Baltimore, and whether certain demographic factors (e.g. gender and race) could be used to predict the volume of noise complaints throughout different parts of the city. We used noise complaint data from Baltimore City along with several machine learning models to see how well the original dataset could be replicated using certain demographic factors as key variables. Below is an image of the final poster that we brought to the event.
