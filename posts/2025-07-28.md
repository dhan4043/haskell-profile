## Overview

These days, it does not take a tech expert to point out the importance and utility of personal data; content recommendations, personalized services, and research are just a few areas that benefit from the collection of user data. However, many users are not aware of *how* data is actually collected by companies. Cookies are well-known and commonly interacted with – through browser pop-ups and alerts – but they are just one of the many tools used to collect user data. In this series I will go over several tracking methods in-depth to help demystify the web. Technical implementations of each method will also be provided when possible.

## What is a Tracking Pixel?

Tracking pixels are HTML graphics placed within webpages or emails to collect some user information. The typical pixel might look something like this:

```html
<img src="https://some-server.com">
```

The size of a tracking pixel is one pixel (hence the name), which makes spotting one basically impossible without looking at the HTML source code. Additionally, pixels are usually styled to appear transparent or hide behind other page elements.

## How Tracking Pixels Work

When you visit a webpage with one of these pixels, your browser will automatically load the URL given by the pixel (“some-server.com” in the above example) expecting an image in return. While the server does in fact return an image, it is a rather useless one, and in exchange for this image your browser shares information about:

- Your operating system
- Your platform (mobile/desktop)
- Your user agent (browser/mail service)
- Your screen resolution
- Your activities (when multiple tracking pixels are placed throughout a website)
- Your IP address
- The time of access

Once all of this data is logged by the server, it can be aggregated and utilized by the company running the webpage (assuming they also run the external server).

## How to Avoid Tracking Pixels

If you wish to prevent data collection through the use of tracking pixels you can:

1. Use Incognito or private mode on your browser
2. Use browser extensions such as [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/), which block the use of tracking pixels

## Implementing a Basic Tracking Pixel

A basic tracking pixel requires two components:

1. A static image file
2. A web server that can send the static image upon request and log user information

In this example, I will use Python to implement a basic web server/logger and host the server on [Render](https://render.com/). The static image in this case is just a PNG that contains a single pixel.

### Source Code

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) is a popular Python framework used to build scalable web apps. Here I am using it to create an app with a single route, “/image,” that returns the static image “pixel.png“ when visited. The entire project can be found in [this](https://github.com/dhan4043/tracking-pixel) repository.

```python
from flask import Flask, send_file, request, render_template_string
import datetime
import urllib.request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/image')
def tracking_pixel():
    # File path and name for 1 x 1 pixel. Must be an absolute path to pixel
    filename = './static/img/pixel.png'
    # Log the User-Agent String
    user_agent = request.headers.get('User-Agent')
    # Get the current time of request and format time into readable format
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.strftime(current_time, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

    # Log the IP address of requester
    get_ip = request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-For', request.remote_addr).split(',')[0]

    # Lookup Geolocation of IP Address
    with urllib.request.urlopen('http://ip-api.com/json/'+ get_ip) as url:
        data = url.read().decode()

    # Add User-Agent, Timestamp, and IP Address + Geolocation information to dictionary
    log_entry = f'Website Opened:\nTimestamp: {timestamp}\nUser Agent: {user_agent}\nIP Address Data: {data}\n'

    # Write log to hardcoded path. Must be an absolute path to the log file
    with open('./logs.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write(log_entry)
    print(log_entry)
    
    return send_file(filename, mimetype='image/png')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Results

Hosting a web service on Render is extremely simple, all you have to do is upload the GitHub repository for your tracking pixel on their website. If your project passes the build stage without any errors, then you should receive a URL for your web app. Visiting this URL (with “/image” added to the end) will trigger the logging function (the output can be viewed in the “logs” section of your Render dashboard). At this point, your logs should look something like this:

![Example Log](/images/tracker-logs.png)

And that’s it! You have successfully built a simple tracking pixel.
